# Bitcoin and Blockchain Learning Project

This repository contains a series of daily code examples and implementations related to Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Each day, a new example will be added to help understand different aspects of cryptocurrency and blockchain development.

## Project Structure

Each example is contained in its own directory under `bitcoin_examples/` with:
- Source code
- README explaining the concepts
- Complete setup instructions
- Working examples

## Daily Examples
