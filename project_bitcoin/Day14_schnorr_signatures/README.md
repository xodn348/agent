# Day 14: Schnorr Signatures Implementation

## Overview
This implementation focuses on Schnorr signatures, a more efficient and flexible digital signature scheme that has been integrated into Bitcoin through the Taproot upgrade.

## Features
1. Key pair generation (private/public key)
2. Signature generation
3. Signature verification
4. Batch verification support
5. Tagged hashing for enhanced security

## Technical Implementation
- Implements the complete Schnorr signature scheme
- Uses secp256k1 curve parameters
- Includes point arithmetic operations
- Provides secure random number generation
- Implements tagged hashing for signature generation

## Security Considerations
- Uses cryptographically secure random number generation
- Implements proper domain separation through tagged hashing
- Follows the BIP340 specification guidelines
- Includes protection against known attack vectors

## Usage
```python
# Create a new Schnorr signature instance
schnorr = SchnorrSignature()

# Generate a keypair
private_key, public_key = schnorr.generate_keypair()

# Sign a message
message = b"Hello, Bitcoin!"
signature = schnorr.sign(private_key, message)

# Verify the signature
is_valid = schnorr.verify(public_key, message, signature)
```

## Benefits Over ECDSA
1. Linearity properties enabling signature aggregation
2. Simpler implementation reducing potential vulnerabilities
3. Smaller signature size
4. Native support for multi-signature schemes
5. Enhanced privacy through signature aggregation

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Basic signing and verification
- Invalid message detection
- Batch verification simulation
- Edge cases and error handling
